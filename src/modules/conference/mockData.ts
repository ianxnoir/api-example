He started his career as attorney-at-law (Bengoshi) in Japan and solicitor in England and Wales following receiving J.D. of University of Tokyo and MSc. of University of Oxford, respectively.  He also serves as an IDAC researcher of Tohoku University, enabling him to manage areas of business, legal and compliance and life science in an integrated manner.\n<br></br>\nCogSmart was founded in Japan as a university spin-off to alleviate the worldwide prevalence of dementia. Backed by years of medical studies at Tohoku University, our integrated solution consists of 3 pillars: AI image analysis technology, large cohort MRI datasets and 20 years of neuroscience studies at Tohoku University. The global issue of dementia is currently being tackled with various solutions, some of which are to support diagnosis, and others to develop drugs. CogSmart takes a pro-active approach - focuses on preventive medicine showing that the risk of dementia can be reduced by modifying the relevant lifestyle traits. More specifically, we provide a set of integrated screening and solution services, achieving the prevention of dementia from early stages. \n<br></br>\nCogSmart expanded into Hong Kong as she is an international financial hub with a robust legal system highly recognized by the international community, paired with strong governmental support in innovation and technology, and great opportunities for building startup connections. CogSmart became the first Japanese company accepted into the “Incu-Bio” incubation programme of Hong Kong Science Park in July 2021, with subsidies provided to further our R&D progress of innovative medical device for dementia prevention and management.",

His experiences as governor of the Bank of England (2013-2020), governor of the Bank of Canada (2008-2013), and now as UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance, offer him a unique position to provide tangible action plans for leaders, companies and countries to transform the value of the market back into the value of humanity.\n<br></br>\nDuring his thirteen-year career with Goldman Sachs, Carney helped a series of emerging economies, including post-apartheid South Africa, gain access to international capital markets. Carney was appointed Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada in August 2003. In November 2004, he left the Bank of Canada to become Senior Associate Deputy Minister of Finance, where he oversaw five budgets during a series of minority parliaments and represented Canada at the G7 and G20. He was appointed as Governor of the Bank of Canada during the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, taking immediate action, including pre- emptively restructuring the $200 billion CDO market, and reducing interest rates before most other countries and committing to hold them down for 12 months after, a groundbreaking move that supported Canadian credit markets and business confidence. As a result of Carney’s actions, Canada was able to return to prerecession levels of output and employment earlier than others in the G7.\n<br></br>\nIn 2012 U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne stunned observers when he declared that Carney would succeed Lord Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England, marking the first time that a non-Briton was appointed to the position. Carney quickly adopted the “forward guidance” strategy he had applied in Canada—navigating the United Kingdom through falling unemployment rates, rising interest rates, and Brexit. He is credited with focusing attention on modern challenges including digital currencies and climate change, launching the bank’s first climate-related stress tests. He stepped down as governor of the Bank of England when his term ended in 2020.\n<br></br>\nHis new book VALUE(S): Building a Better World for All, is a meditation on his experiences that examines the short-comings and challenges of the market in the past decade which he argues has led to rampant, public distrust and the need for radical change.\n<br></br>\nCarney earned his bachelor’s degree from Harvard University, and went on to receive both a master’s\n<br></br>\ndegree and doctorate in Economics from Oxford University. He now resides in Ottawa, Canada",

This presents immense opportunities for policy makers and private sector to work together to shape a greener and more inclusive future for the global economy.  In the process, it is also a pressing mission for financial regulators to assess and address the risks to the financial system arising from climate change using reliable financial information, appropriate diagnostics and effective policy instruments.  \n<br></br>\nThis session brings together a group of eminent financial policy makers to exchange views on how the financial system can better support a green and sustainable global recovery, while keeping climate-related financial risks at bay.",

With programmatic DOOH still in its early stages in Hong Kong and other APAC markets, we will still continue to see the channel grow in popularity in the region and it is easy to say that the benefits in shifting to a programmatic model will also continue to grow. </p><p>In this session, Sally will discuss the current trend of programmatic DOOH, the new ways of digitalization panel, sharing her viewpoint on how programmatic DOOH provides more control of targeting and measurement, and ultimately bringing more advantages for advertisers with more accurate reach to consumers at every stage of the funnel. She will also present some of the ways Hivestack is revolutionising the industry through its full stack of ad technology including its DSP, SPP and AdServer products as well as some success stories in the local market.</p><div><strong class=\"subTitle\">Sponsored by:</strong><div class=\"sp_logo\" style=\"margin-top: 6px\"><img alt=\"Hivestack\" src=\"https://info.hktdc.com/dm/marketingpulse/2022/website/img/hivestack-logo.png\" /></div></div>",

With programmatic DOOH still in its early stages in Hong Kong and other APAC markets, we will still continue to see the channel grow in popularity in the region and it is easy to say that the benefits in shifting to a programmatic model will also continue to grow. </p><p>In this session, Sally will discuss the current trend of programmatic DOOH, the new ways of digitalization panel, sharing her viewpoint on how programmatic DOOH provides more control of targeting and measurement, and ultimately bringing more advantages for advertisers with more accurate reach to consumers at every stage of the funnel. She will also present some of the ways Hivestack is revolutionising the industry through its full stack of ad technology including its DSP, SPP and AdServer products as well as some success stories in the local market.</p><div><strong class=\"subTitle\">Sponsored by:</strong><div class=\"sp_logo\" style=\"margin-top: 6px\"><img alt=\"Hivestack\" src=\"https://info.hktdc.com/dm/marketingpulse/2022/website/img/hivestack-logo.png\" /></div></div>",

With programmatic DOOH still in its early stages in Hong Kong and other APAC markets, we will still continue to see the channel grow in popularity in the region and it is easy to say that the benefits in shifting to a programmatic model will also continue to grow. </p><p>In this session, Sally will discuss the current trend of programmatic DOOH, the new ways of digitalization panel, sharing her viewpoint on how programmatic DOOH provides more control of targeting and measurement, and ultimately bringing more advantages for advertisers with more accurate reach to consumers at every stage of the funnel. She will also present some of the ways Hivestack is revolutionising the industry through its full stack of ad technology including its DSP, SPP and AdServer products as well as some success stories in the local market.</p><div><strong class=\"subTitle\">Sponsored by:</strong><div class=\"sp_logo\" style=\"margin-top: 6px\"><img alt=\"Hivestack\" src=\"https://info.hktdc.com/dm/marketingpulse/2022/website/img/hivestack-logo.png\" /></div></div>",
